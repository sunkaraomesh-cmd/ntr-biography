    <h2 id="career">Career</h2>
    <p>N. T. Rama Rao Jr.'s acting journey began early with a cameo in the 1991 film Brahmarshi Viswamitra, appearing alongside his grandfather, the Indian matinee idol N. T. Rama Rao. In 1997, he made his debut as a child artist in the title role of Rama in the mythological film Ramayanam, directed by Gunasekhar. The film won the National Film Award for Best Children's Film, and his performance received critical acclaim.[16] Director K. Raghavendra Rao, impressed by his performance in Ramayanam and later auditions, recommended him to S. S. Rajamouli for his directorial debut Student No: 1 (2001). Around the same time, producer Ramoji Rao signed him for the romantic drama Ninnu Choodalani (2001), which marked his debut as a lead actor at just 17 years of age. Student No: 1, which released later that year, became a commercial success, establishing him as a promising young talent, while Subbu (2001) that followed had an average performance at the box office.

His major breakthrough came with V. V. Vinayaks Aadi (2002), in which he portrayed a young man seeking revenge against a powerful landlord for his parents deaths. The film became one of the highest-grossing Telugu films of the year and solidified his mass appeal.[18] He subsequently appeared in Allari Ramudu (2002) directed by B. Gopal, and the political political drama Naaga (2003) produced by A. M. Rathnam. Both films underperformed at the box office, although Naaga received critical acclaim for its political themes and Rama Rao Jr.'s performance. In 2003, Rama Rao Jr. reunited with S. S. Rajamouli for Simhadri, made on a budget of ₹8.5 crore. The film became the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time upon release, cementing his stardom and earning him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor Telugu.[19] For the role, he adopted a more rugged and mature look, shedding his earlier youthful image. His intense performance and commanding screen presence at just 19 earned him the moniker “Young Tiger”, a title that has remained associated with him since.[20]</p>
